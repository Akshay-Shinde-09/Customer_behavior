Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis
📌 Overview

This project showcases an end-to-end data analytics workflow, including data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL querying, dashboard creation, reporting, and presentation. It demonstrates the complete analytical pipeline expected in real-world data roles.

📂 Dataset

The dataset is loaded using Python (Pandas).

Contains information related to customer behaviour / sales trends / operations (replace with actual dataset when uploading).

Raw dataset is stored under:
/data/raw/

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib / Seaborn)

PostgreSQL (for SQL queries and insights)

Power BI (dashboard creation & visualization)

Jupyter Notebook (EDA & cleaning)

Gama / PPT (final presentation)

🚀 Steps Performed
1. Data Loading

Imported the dataset using Pandas.

Verified structure, data types, and initial statistics.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Checked missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

Generated summary statistics & visualized key patterns.

Examined distributions, correlations, and category trends.

3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values (imputation/removal).

Treated outliers using IQR / domain logic.

Fixed inconsistent data types & formatted columns.

Removed duplicates and standardized formatting.

4. SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)

Loaded cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL.

Ran skill-oriented SQL queries such as:

Joins

Aggregations

Window functions

Subqueries

Extracted insights and validated patterns found in Python.

5. Power BI Dashboard

Imported cleaned data into Power BI.

Designed an interactive dashboard with visuals such as:

KPI cards

Bar/line charts

Slicers/filters

Trend & comparison visuals

Dashboard file saved in /dashboard/.

6. Report Creation

A summary report explaining findings, trends, and business recommendations.

PDF report stored in /reports/.

7. Presentation (Gama / PPT)

Created a final presentation summarizing:

Project objective

EDA insights

SQL findings

Dashboard walkthrough

Final conclusions
